<p> Story of Louise Hay, a famous author who cured herself of ovarian cancer, tells the story of how she used to get up in the
    morning and say, "Ugh, another crappy day"" and sure enough she would have another crappy day. She decided to change
    her mind and wake up in the morning and say "I’m so thankful for a new day, it’s going to be great." Just that little
    change made all of the difference in the world.</p>
