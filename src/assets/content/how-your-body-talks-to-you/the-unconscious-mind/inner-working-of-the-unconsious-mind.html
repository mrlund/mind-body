<h1>The inner workings of the unconscious mind</h1>
<hr class="line">
<p>The subconscious mind is a like a big memory bank that stores your <a href="https://www.2knowmyself.com/How_beliefs_are_formed"
        target="_blank">beliefs</a>, memories and life experiences. This information that is stored in your subconscious mind
    always affects your behavior and actions in different situations.</p>
<p>Here is another example that will help you understand how the subconscious mind works. If you lack self-confidence because
    of certain beliefs that you have about yourself (that are stored in your subconscious mind) then you might start to feel
    anxious around people.
</p>
<p>In this case you felt anxious because your subconscious mind had false information that made you believe that you were in
    danger while in fact you were not.</p>
<p>One of the very interesting facts about the way the subconscious mind works is that it won't only affect your behavior but
    it will also affect your perception of events. If in the previous case you saw two people smiling while looking at you
    then you might believe that theyâ€™re making fun of you.</p>
<p>Your subconscious mind follows a rule called "you get what you focus on". Because you had a false belief about yourself you
    found a proof for it even though it wasn't real.</p>
