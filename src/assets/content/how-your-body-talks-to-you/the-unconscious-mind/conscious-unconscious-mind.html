<h1 class="line">Here is what you must do in order to make your subconscious mind work for you:
</h1>
<p><b>Change your subconscious beliefs by actions:</b> If you want to change a subconscious belief such as "I am not good at
    math" then you need to take serious actions to get good grades in the next math exam. Only then your subconscious belief
    will be changed.</p>
<p><b>Don't go against your subconscious beliefs:</b> Don't use affirmations that don't make sense to your subconscious mind
    because they will never work (see <a href="https://www.2knowmyself.com/Do_positive_affirmations_work" target="_blank"> Why don't positive affirmations work)</a></p>
<p><b>The Subconscious needs your cooperation:</b> Some people think that they can use their subconscious minds to lose weight
    while eating whatever they want. This is the way people think who don't know how the subconscious mind works. You can
    use your subconscious mind to lose weight by modifying certain beliefs that are preventing you from taking action.</p>
