<h1 class="line">Harness Your Unconscious Mind</h1>

<h3 class="line">Activities to Harness Your Unconscious Mind---Your unconscious mind has a strong, powerful influence in your life. To harness
    its power and direct its influence in positive, helpful ways, these actions are suggested:
</h3>
<p><b>Express yourself artistically:</b> Any artistic activity----coloring, drawing or painting---uses the unconscious by allowing
    creative work to surface and help you express your true feelings. To tap into your unconscious mind draw a picture of
    whatever comes to mind. You don’t necessarily need to be a great artist, just open to the process of creating.
</p>
<p><b>Rehearse desired outcomes: </b>A great way to program a new activity, skill or thought into your unconscious mind is to
    rehearse it and repeat it until it takes root. Songs are lodged in your unconscious and something triggers them, from
    some earlier point in your life. Similarly, you can rehearse new attitudes, ideas, outcomes and thoughts. By repeating
    what you want several times in a row on a daily basis, you will help your subconscious mind catch on and help you achieve
    your desired outcomes.
</p>
<p>Write literally anything and everything that comes to mind. Over time, as you stick with this habit — ideally as a weekly
    and even daily activity — your brain will work its way into your unconscious, uncovering and surfacing valuable insights
    and thoughts you may not have even realized you had. If you are in the habit of keeping a diary or journal, you probably
    already experience the many benefits related to this practice.
