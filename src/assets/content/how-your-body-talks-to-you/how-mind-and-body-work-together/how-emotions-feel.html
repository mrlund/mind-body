    <h3 slot="header">Activity 1</h3>
    <div slot="body">
        <p>Think of something in the last couple of days that was upsetting - try to feel exactly how you felt - where
            do you feel that physically in
            your body? Every time you experience emotion - your body gets into a pattern - if you don’t feel it and
            release it - that’s how disease is experienced in the body.</p>
        <p>The repetitive pattern of your thinking can lead to either disease or wellbeing and you can train your
            thoughts just like you train
            your body.</p>

        <p>Positive emotions can affect your health. So let us practice
            prioritizing positive emotions.</p>
        <p>Break up in pairs – each partner will tell a story about something positive. Try to really
            feel the positive emotion and let go of negative thoughts.</p>
