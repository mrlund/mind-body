    <div slot="body">
        <p>Think of something in the last couple of days that was upsetting - feel how you felt - where do you feel that in
            your body? Every time you feel that kind of feeling - your body gets into a pattern - if you don’t feel it and
            release it - that’s how disease is experienced in the body.</p>

        <p>The repetitive pattern of your thinking produces disease or wellbeing and you can train your thoughts just like you train
            your body.</p>
