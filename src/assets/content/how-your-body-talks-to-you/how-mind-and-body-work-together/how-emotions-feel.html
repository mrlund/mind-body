<h3>Complete the following activities</h3>
<p>Think of something in the last couple of days that was upsetting - feel how you felt - where do you feel that in your body? Every time you feel that kind of feeling - your body gets into a pattern - if you don’t feel it and release it - that’s how disease is experienced in the body</p>
<p>The repetitive pattern of your thinking produces disease or wellbeing and you can train your thoughts just like you train your body.</p>
<h3>Main activity</h3>
<p>Break up in pairs – each partner will tell a story about something positive</p>
