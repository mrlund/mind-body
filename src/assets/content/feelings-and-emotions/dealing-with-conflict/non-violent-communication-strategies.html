<h3>Key non-violent communication strategies:</h3>
<p>
    1-Don’t accuse, blame, threaten or label or tell someone they “should”
</p>
<p>
    2-If someone is behaving aggressively, you can ask yourself what they need. However, if it’s too emotionally draining, it
    is okay to walk away and say "their negativity is not my problem."
</p>
<p>
    3-Understand that people are not obligated to cater to your feelings. If someone says no to your request, avoid getting angry
    or guilt-tripping them.
