<h3>Activity Create a situation and have girls role play: “How can I defuse negative emotions?”</h3>
<p>
    Don’t ignore or belittle emotions. Do yourself and others a favor, stop pretending everything’s okay when in reality it isn’t.
</p>
<p>Explore values. Anger indicates we care deeply about something, for example.</p>
<p>Ask, “What do you want?” Emotionally charged people frequently blame others and forget what they want.</p>
<p>Ask, “What can you do to get what you want?”</p>
<p>When possible, postpone; allow time for feelings to cool.</p>
<p>Avoid threatening postures, step back a few inches. “In your face” doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Invite them to sit with you. Sit to the side rather than head on.</p>
<p>Create open space between; remove barriers.</p>
<p>Lower your voice.</p>
<p>Soften your tone.</p>
<p>Follow up, if you postponed. Some emotions – if not addressed – grow destructive with time, bitterness for example.</p>
<p>Step back and explore the big picture. It’s not about sides.</p>
<p>Avoid being pressured to make decisions.</p>
