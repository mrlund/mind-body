<h1>Heat of emotion</h1>
<hr class="line" />
<p>When you allow yourself to act in anger, your performance will drop, because you will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lose focus</li>
    <li>Shift attention to retaliation</li>
    <li>Start negative self-talk and self-criticism</li>
    <li>Let yourself get distracted and sloppy</li>
    <li>Lose confidence</li>
</ul>
