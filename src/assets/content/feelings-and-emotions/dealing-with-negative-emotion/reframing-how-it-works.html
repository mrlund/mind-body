<h1>Reframing: How Does It Work? Using reframing techniques can be simple and easy, especially with practice.</h1>

<p><b>Educate yourself about your thought patterns and how they affect you</b> is important for laying the groundwork for understanding
    and change. Understand that your frame of mind and mood may create  distortions in your thinking. See which ones, if
    any, may come into play in your life. Since pessimists tend to experience more stress and less success than optimists,
    it's important to adopt a positive way of seeing things.</p>
<p> <b>Notice Your Thoughts.</b> Catch yourself when you're slipping into overly negative and stressful patterns of thinking.
    Being aware of them is an important part of challenging and ultimately changing them. just notice them at first. If you
    want, you can even keep a journal and start recording what's happening in your life and your thoughts surrounding these
    events, and then examine these thoughts through your new 'lens' to get more practice in catching these thoughts.</p>
<p> <b>Challenge Your Thoughts.</b> As you notice your negative thoughts, an effective part of reframing involves examining the
    truth and accuracy (or lack thereof) of these thoughts. Are the things you're telling yourself even true? Also, what
    are some other ways to interpret the same set of events? Which ways of seeing things serve you better? Instead of seeing
    things the way you always have, challenge every negative thought, and see if you can adopt thoughts that fit your situation
    but reflect a more positive outlook.</p>
<p> <b>Replace Your Thoughts With More Positive Thoughts</b> When you're looking at something negative, see if you can change
    your self talk to use less strong, less negative emotions. When you're looking at a potentially stressful situation,
    see if you can view it as a challenge versus a threat. Look for the 'gift' in each situation, and see if you can see
    your stressors on the more positive edge of reality: see them in a way that still fits the facts of your situation, but
    that is less negative and more optimistic and positive.
