    <b>On Your Brain</b>-Imagine your boyfriend or girlfriend with someone new or compare your grades to that of a longtime
    rival and your amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex–the centers in your brain for fear, anger, and disgust–swing
    into high gear. Courtesy of the anterior cingulate cortex, social pain is experienced much the same way as physical pain.</p>
<p><b>On Your Stomach</b>-Overhear your teacher praise someone in your class that’s the teacher’s pet and your lunch looks a
    whole lot less delicious. The threat of a challenger who outshines you–activates a fear reaction in the amygdala, triggering
    the fight-or-flight response that ramps up production of adrenaline and noradrenaline. One result? No more appetite.</p>
<p><b>On Your Eyes</b>-Constantly worried that your boy/girlfriend might not be faithful? You’ll find yourself staring down
    potential rivals–especially attractive ones. People who are consistently jealous of a possibly cheating boy/girlfriend
    pay close attention to any good-looking members of their ow/opposite sex and form strong memories of what they look like,
    according to recent research in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.</p>
<p><b>On Your Heart</b>-The sympathetic nervous system buckles under the stress of jealousy, quickening the heart and spiking
    blood pressure. If you find yourself having chest pains, avoid hotshot who outshine you, the person who took away your
    true love, and blogs about the life you wish you had.</p>
