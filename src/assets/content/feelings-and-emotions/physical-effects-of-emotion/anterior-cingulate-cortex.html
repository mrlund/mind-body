<p>The anterior cingulate gyrus is involved in a number of functions including emotional processing and vocalization of emotions.
    It has connections with speech and vocalization areas in the frontal lobes. This includes the area which controls motor
    functions involved with speech production. The cingulate gyrus is involved in emotional bonding and attachment, particularly
    between mother and child.
