<p>This is an MRI of the brain, highlighting the limbic system. The limbic system is involved in instinct, emotion and establishing
    memories. It consists of an arc of structures, such as the amygdala (light blue, lower centre), that lie below the corpus
    callosum (green layer, centre). The thalamus (purple), caudate nucleus (bright pink, part of the basal ganglia) and cingulate
    gyrus (pale pink, above the corpus callosum) are also seen. This image was compiled from successive slice MRI scans at
    the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (LONI) at UCLA.
