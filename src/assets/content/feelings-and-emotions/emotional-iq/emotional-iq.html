<p><b>Self-awareness:</b> Self-awareness involves knowing your own feelings. This includes having an accurate assessment of
    what you’re capable of, when you need help, and what your emotional triggers are.
</p>
<p><b>Self-management:</b> This involves being able to keep your emotions in check when they become disruptive. Self-management
    involves being able to control outbursts, calmly discussing disagreements, and avoiding activities that undermine you
    like extended self-pity or panic</p>
<p><b>Motivation:</b> Everyone is motivated to action by rewards like money or status. Goleman’s model, however, refers to motivation
    for the sake of personal joy, curiosity, or the satisfaction of being productive.
</p>
<p><b>Empathy:</b> While the three previous categories refer to a person’s internal emotions, this one deals with the emotions
    of others. Empathy is the skill and practice of reading the emotions of others and responding appropriately.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Social skills:</b> This category involves the application of empathy as well as negotiating the needs of others with
    your own. This can include finding common ground with others, managing others in a work environment, and being persuasive.
