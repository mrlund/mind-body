<h3 class="line">How different
    emotions are expressed nonverbally</h3>

<p>In this activity, the
    group will practice nonverbal
    communication, sometimes called
    “body language”</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each of you will have a turn to
        demonstrate the feeling on your card
        while saying this phrase out loud.</li>
    <li>You may use sounds, facial
        expressions, and body language,
        but you may not say anything
        other than the words written on
        this newsprint.</li>
    <li>The group will then try to
        guess what emotion you are
        displaying.</li>
    <li>Keep in mind that some
        emotions are more difficult to
        express than others. Just do
        your best to act out the emotion
        you get.</li>
    <li>If no one in the group guesses
        your emotion, you will have one
        chance to perform it again. If the
        group still can’t guess the emotion,
        show them your card.</li>
</ul>
